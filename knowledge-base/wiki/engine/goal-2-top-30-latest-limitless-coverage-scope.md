# Goal 2 Top 30 Latest-Limitless Coverage Scope

- Updated: 2026-07-07
- Sources: Project codebase; local validation; live Limitless metagame and card-breakdown pages (2026-06-23)
- Raw: N/A — codebase update

## Purpose

This is the first durable Goal 2 scope page for Prizmo's top-30 latest-Limitless coverage work.

Goal 2 is not defined by one or two archetypes anymore. It is defined by the current live top 30 Limitless archetypes by usage share, plus the union card corpus from each archetype's detailed card breakdown page for the active format.

As of 2026-06-23, the repository now has first-class Goal 2 reporting code:

- `mix prizmo.goal2.top30`
- `mix prizmo.goal2.corpus`
- shared classifier `lib/prizmo/tcg/card_coverage.ex`

Those reports are the canonical starting point for autonomous Goal 2 implementation work.

## Current live snapshot

- Metagame source: `https://limitlesstcg.com/decks?show=100`
- Active metagame format on validation date: `TEF-CRI`
- Selected corpus rule: top 30 archetypes by live share with `share > 0.00`, using the non-variant metagame page and each archetype's `/decks/:id/cards` breakdown page.

### Current union corpus summary

- Tracked top archetypes: `30`
- Tracked cards with usage greater than `0.00`: `377`
- Coverage buckets from `mix prizmo.goal2.corpus`:
  - `supported=169`
  - `generic-supported=8`
  - `partial=10`
  - `unimplemented=190`
- Metadata buckets:
  - `cached=190`
  - `missing=187`

Important interpretation:

- The current report is a support classifier and prioritization aid, not a full browser/runtime validation ledger.
- It reliably distinguishes cards with executable engine/catalog support from cards that are still partial or unimplemented.
- It does **not** yet infer a separate per-card `unvalidated` state from tests, fixtures, or browser evidence.

## High-leverage shared blockers

The strongest current Goal 2 implementation candidates are the incomplete cards shared by the most archetypes and/or the most total metagame share.

The latest Goal 2 engine batch closed `PRE-116` Max Rod after Powerglass. Max Rod now has committed TCGdex metadata and executable ACE SPEC Item behavior: during the action window, it prompts over owned discard-pile Pokémon and Basic Energy cards, returns up to five selected cards to hand, filters out Trainers and Special Energy, and marks the player's once-per-game ACE SPEC flag through the generic Trainer play path.

### Highest-priority remaining `unimplemented` cards from current report

| Card | Archetypes | Total share | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PRE-086` Regigigas | `2` | `5.30%` | Shared Pokémon blocker in the Hydrapple/Metagross overlap. |
| Hydrapple/Ogerpon Grass line cluster (`ASC-008`, `MEG-008`, `MEG-009`, `MEG-010`, `SFA-006`, `TEF-126`) | `2` | `5.15%` | Shared cluster behind Regigigas; split into coherent card batches after confirming metadata/text. |

### Shared `partial` cards worth finishing after the broad unimplemented slice

| Card | Archetypes | Total share | Current status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TWM-064` Wellspring Mask Ogerpon ex | `5` | `58.19%` | `partial` |
| `TWM-167` Legacy Energy | `6` | `9.34%` | `partial` |
| `WHT-086` Ignition Energy | `5` | `7.74%` | `partial` |
| `POR-086` Growing Grass Energy | `4` | `13.34%` | `partial` |
| `TEF-069` Bronzong | `2` | `49.37%` | `partial` |

## Relationship to earlier roadmap work

The old Goal 1 and six-deck work is still useful here because several earlier targets remain in the current top 30:

- Dragapult is still `#1`.
- Alakazam is still `#6`.
- Raging Bolt is still `#7`.
- Festival Lead is still `#11`.
- Rocket's Mewtwo is still `#13`.
- Mega Lopunny is still `#19`.

That means prior Goal 1 and six-deck coverage was not wasted; it now acts as seeded support inside the broader Goal 2 corpus. The new work should prioritize primitives that lift multiple new archetypes at once instead of returning to already-closed Goal 1 validation unless a regression appears.

## Recommended next implementation order

1. Take `PRE-086` Regigigas next as the default highest-share remaining shared Pokémon blocker unless a broader primitive re-ranks above it.
2. Treat the Hydrapple/Ogerpon Grass line cluster as the next 5.15% shared queue after Regigigas, splitting it into coherent card batches instead of trying to close all tied cards at once by default.
3. Keep the remaining Dragapult-only cached pair `TWM-099` / `TWM-100` as deliberate single-archetype cleanup, not the default autonomous queue.
4. Finish the remaining shared partials only after the broad unimplemented slice unless another batch naturally extends the new HP infrastructure; if returning to HP work soon, `POR-086` Growing Grass Energy remains the strongest follow-up.
5. Keep using `mix prizmo.goal2.corpus` after each batch to re-rank the next blockers by archetype count and weighted share.
